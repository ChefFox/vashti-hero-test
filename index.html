      <p>Something has brought you to this space – this page: maybe grief, a loss, anxiety, stress, overwhelm.<br>
      You may not even know what is wrong, but you just know something is not right.<br>
      You may feel your heart hurts.</p>

      <p>Together, we will explore – enquire with curiosity – what is going on for you.<br>
      You will not have to explain anything perfectly or have anything figured out.<br>
      And you have done the hardest bit already because you are here.</p>
